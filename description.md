GitLab is a sophisticated Ruby on Rails app for hosting Git repositories.
Its features include an issue tracker, a wiki,
and an editor that allows you to compose and push commits entirely from a web interface.

This version of GitLab has been slimmed down to work better as a Sandstorm app.
Some upstream features, such as multiproject management, user permissions, web hooks,
and LDAP authentication, are omitted,
either because they are better handled by Sandstorm itself
or because they are dependent on as-yet-unimplemented features of Sandstorm.
